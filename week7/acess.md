## Notes
- Think about blind people! My CTW prof is legally blind and need his computer set up to have BOLD text and a big mouse, so I think about him
- I know there are companies who search for ADA violations just to sue
- COLOR CONTRAST IS ESSENTIAL how is your user supposed to read? if the contrast blurs and makes your eyes hurt?
