#   UX/UI Lecture 

## Notes
- Aesthetic design trends move fast, but usability remains
- JS wasnt really a thing in the 90's
- people dont like to read think of marketing 
-  the best way to convey info is pictures and videos
- think about web conventions, unvisited vs visted colors

## Exercise 
Example Website #7
- text size is too big 
- color contrast is bad needs a new color palate
- source code isnt semantic 
- Typography ( not a fan of the font)
- made using WIX not a bad thing but basic templates 
- page includes a nav bar but its only a single page so it just makes you scroll down, also just way too long of a page I dont think this would work well on a mobile device
- people have terrible attention spans now so we have to learn how to apeal to them
- websites need to mold to the viewing device this is done by px width 
- Webpages do not look the same in all major browsers
